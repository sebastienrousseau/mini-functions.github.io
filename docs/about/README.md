## Introduction

**Mini Functions is a highly performant utility and wrapper functions
library for Rust that has been carefully designed with optimization and
efficiency in mind.**

By providing convenient wrapper functions, our library aims to provide
a high-level interface for common tasks while still leveraging the
performance benefits of Rust under the hood.

These utility functions serve as an essential toolkit for any Rust
developer, and the library's design abstractions allow for easy
integration into a variety of projects and applications.
